## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Introduction to Technological Progress**

Technological progress refers to improvements in production techniques, management methods, or tools that enable higher output from the same level of input (e.g., capital and labor). In economics, it is commonly measured by the **Solow ​**​​**Residual**​, which captures the portion of economic growth not accounted for by increases in capital or labor.

### **1.2 ​**​**Primary**​**​ Drivers of Technological Progress**

According to ​**endogenous growth theory**​, technological progress originates from within the economic system, driven primarily by innovation, R&D investment, and knowledge accumulation. Improvements in education and human capital further enhance productivity and foster innovation, while capital deepening strengthens this process by enabling the adoption of advanced technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence.

### **1.3 Research Questions**

This study leverages an economic simulation platform to investigate the long-term effects of technological progress on economic and social dynamics, focusing on:

* ​**Wage levels**​: Does technological progress raise or lower average wages?
* ​**Income inequality**​: Does it widen or narrow the wealth gap between individuals?
* ​**Aggregate output**​: How does technological progress impact GDP?

### **1.4 Research Significance**

* **Understanding Growth Mechanisms**  Analyzing how technological progress affects the labor market helps reveal the underlying drivers of economic growth, offering policy insights to guide sustainable development and improve social welfare.
* **Optimizing Income Distribution**  As technological progress may either exacerbate or alleviate income inequality, studying its effects can inform the design of equitable tax and social security policies to ensure inclusive economic development.

## 2. **Selected Economic Roles**

As an example, we selected the following roles from the social role classification of the economic simulation platform. These roles align with the core understanding of the issue and are convenient to implement from an experimental perspective:

| Social Role            | Selected Type                         | Role Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Households             | OLG Model                             | Analyze the impact of technological progress on the labor market across different age groups                      |
| Government            | Treasury Department                   | Study how the government responds to unemployment and income distribution issues caused by tech progress          |
| Market                 | Perfect Competition                   | Simulate how firms adjust labor demand and production decisions in response to technological change               |
| Financial Institutions | Arbitrage-Free Financial Institutions | Assess the impact of technological progress on financial markets, such as borrowing demand and investment returns |

### **Households → Overlapping Generations (OLG) Model**

* The OLG model is particularly suitable for studying the direct impact of technological progress on the labor market. It allows for the simulation of labor-related issues associated with demographic structure changes across different generations.

### **Government → Treasury Department ​**

* Technological progress may lead to rising income inequality or increased unemployment. The government, through the Treasury Department , is responsible for formulating policy responses—such as taxation or subsidies—to mitigate these effects.

### **Market → Perfect Competition**

* In a perfectly competitive market, wages are determined by supply and demand. This structure allows the model to more directly reflect the impact of technological progress on firm-level wage setting and labor demand.

### **Financial Institutions → Arbitrage-Free Financial Institutions**

* Technological progress can influence investment returns and capital market dynamics. Therefore, arbitrage-free financial institutions are selected to simulate impacts on variables such as interest rates. Commercial banks are not selected in this context, as their focus is primarily on deposit and lending activities, which have a more limited scope of influence in this setting.

## 3. **Selected Agent Algorithms**

*(This section provides a recommended agent configuration. Users are encouraged to adjust agent types based on the specific needs of their experiments.)*

| Social Role            | AI Agent Type    | Role Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Households             | Rule-Based Agent | Determine household decisions on consumption, savings, and labor in response to technological progress.      |
| Government             | RL Agent         | Regulate government behavior based on the principle of maximizing long-term social welfare.                  |
| Market                 | Rule-Based Agent | Define how firms adjust wages, production scale, and hiring decisions in response to technological change.   |
| Financial Institutions | Rule-Based Agent | Set interest rates and investment returns to assess the impact of technological progress on capital markets. |

### **Households → Rule-Based Agent**

* Since this economic simulation does not involve optimal policy solving, household behavior can be modeled using rule-based agents. For example, a decision rule might state: "If wages increase, then consumption increases."

### **Government → RL Agent**

* Government behavior is modeled using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which learns how to **respond based on long-term reward ​**​**optimization** through training and interaction with the environment.

### **Market → Rule-Based Agent**

* In a perfectly competitive market, firms’ labor demand and production decisions can be defined by **economic supply** and ​**demand rules**​. Therefore, a rule-based agent is used to represent firm behavior under technological progress.

### **Financial Institutions → Rule-Based Agent**

* Interest rate adjustments in financial markets can be governed by economic principles. For example, "Technological progress increases the return on capital, which in turn affects the interest rate." Rule-based agents are used to simulate such mechanisms.

## 4. **Illustrative Experiment**

```python
# Scenario setup related to technological progress
# Z represents the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) level

# Default: In general, Z_t is updated by adding noise in the logarithmic space
At each time step:
    1. Compute log(Z_t)
    2. Add a random noise term (e.g., drawn from uniform or normal distribution)
    3. Exponentiate the result to obtain the updated Z_t
# Technological Progress: Assume a 1% annual growth in TFP on top of the existing value
At each time step:
    1. Compute log(Z_t)
    2. Add a fixed technological growth term (e.g., 1% per period)
    3. Add a random noise term to represent uncertainty
    4. Exponentiate the result to get updated Z_t
```

* ​**Involved Social Roles**​:
  * ​*Market*​: Perfectly Competitive Market
  * ​*Households*​: OLG Model
* **AI**​​**​ Agents**​:
  * ​*Market*​: Rule-Based Agent
  * ​*Households*​:Rule-Based Agent
  * ​*Government*​: RL Agent
* ​**Experimental Variables**​:
  * Speed of technological progress (or parameters representing tech growth)
  * Income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient)
* **​ Visualized Experimental Results：**

![](https://yqq94nlzjex.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=YzQ3ZjdiZGI1OTFmNzFlYTg2NjlkMTcxZTg2ODhmYjhfY0JtZ0lDTGplUVhBbHpuSmpIdzZDd0dqY0lDbUpYeDVfVG9rZW46VzkydWJZZFZNb09DZ0F4dENZT2NzZXBpblZkXzE3NDcyMjcwNjg6MTc0NzIzMDY2OF9WNA)

​**Figure 2**​: When technological progress accelerates (green line), income inequality increases compared to the case of normal progress (blue line), with a higher Gini coefficient indicating more severe social inequality.

* Technological progress has led to an increase in income inequality in society (as indicated by the rise in the ​**Gini coefficient**​), suggesting that the wage growth rate of high-skilled workers will outpace that of general workers, thereby creating a larger income ​**disparity**​.
